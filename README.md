# la-unit-construction

*Los Angeles has a housing shortage. How well has it been able to construct places to live?*

### Next steps
- [x] Connect to Socrata API
- [x] Calculate residential construction totals by ZIP code and year
- [x] Pair ZIP code data with other statistics (demographics, economics, etc.)
- [ ] Get expert opinions
- [x] Create website to view data for a given ZIP code in the city
- [x] Connect to SendGrid API
- [x] Format and send newsletters

## Project goals
  * Illustrate connection between demographic data/socioeconomic factors and the construction of housing in LA amid the city's housing crisis
  * Determine whether targeted policies to promote housing construction are having a positive effect
  * Make large, opaque datasets easier to understand for the public

## Buildout plan
1. Every week, run a Python script to grab current data from city API and save/update database tables
	* First table will contain the stats you want for each ZIP code and a list of the projects in the previous week
	* Second table will contain rankings and counts for ZIP codes for each year and all time

2. Connect to other data sources, for example:
	* Demographic data by ZIP code
	* Rental cost data by ZIP code
	* A table of ZIP codes and rough neighborhood names

3. Base PHP will grab data from the file on the server as long as it is there and display it on a webpage

4. Separately, every week, run PHP to create a newsletter and send it to SendGrid
	* Before running that script, verify that last modified date of the file is the same as todayâ€™s date (may need Python to just write the date when it runs to edit the file)

## Sources
  * LA City open data portal
  * US Census Bureau American Communities Survey (2017, 5-year estimates)
  * LA County open data (for associating ZIP codes with community names, like "Downtown Los Angeles" for 90015)
