This dataset includes only housing approved under the jurisdiction of the city of Los Angeles, so other cities (like Santa Monica or Burbank) and unincorporated LA County land (like Willowbrook or Marina Del Rey) are not included.</p>

        <small>Metro Rail station data comes from the <a href="https://developer.metro.net/introduction/gis-data/download-gis-data/">Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a>.</small> -->

        <p>Demographic data (including housing costs and median income) comes from the US Census Bureau 2017 American Communities Survey.</p>
